#  AvtoVAZ Fan Website
A fun little website dedicated to classic Soviet-era cars produced by [AvtoVAZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AvtoVAZ). Mostly html, css and php, very little javascript.

Includes:

+ a home page with cards about different car models
+ a quiz page: which AvtoVaz car suits you? (written in php based on [this](https://www.lockedownseo.com/build-a-quiz-in-php-tutorial/) tutorial)
